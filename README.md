# Debug info
Debug information
Successful tests:
I. Gauge field simulation
    1. Energy conserved
    2. Gauss law fulfilled
    3. Evolution of gluon distribution matches results from Boguslavksi et al.
    
II. NRQCD field
    1. Norm of quark and antiquark propagator conserved
    2. Evolution from t1 to t2 and then backwards from t2 to t1 results in the initial value
    3. Free spectral function
